### 2. Rule-Based Labeling Service
**File**: `src/services/ruleBasedLabelingService.js`

**Purpose**: Classify learning styles using heuristic rules (cold start solution)

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Classifies all 4 FSLSM dimensions (-11 to +11 scale)
- ‚úÖ Calculates confidence scores based on data quality

- Mode usage: 40-50% weight
- Activity patterns: 20-30% weight
- Behavioral preferences: 10-20% weight
- Clamps scores to -11 to +11 range (ILS standard)

**Confidence Calculation**:
- Based on data completeness (0-100%)
- Adjusted by feature availability
- Higher confidence with more meaningful data
