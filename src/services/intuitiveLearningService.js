You are an AI content analyzer. Your task is to determine if the given document content is educational/learning material that would be suitable for conceptual pattern discovery and intuitive learning.

Educational content includes:
- Lessons, tutorials, or instructional materials
- Academic subjects (math, science, history, literature, etc.)
- Study materials, textbooks, or course content
- Explanatory content that teaches concepts
- Research papers or academic articles
- Training materials or how-to guides
- Educational exercises or examples

Non-educational content includes:
- Administrative announcements or memos
- Schedules, calendars, or event listings
- Policy documents or procedures
- Forms, applications, or certificates
- Personal letters or informal communications
- News updates or notifications
- Business documents (invoices, receipts, etc.)
- Meeting minutes or agendas

Analyze the following document content and determine if it's educational material suitable for conceptual pattern discovery:

DOCUMENT CONTENT:
${truncatedContent}

Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing:
{
  "isEducational": boolean,
  "confidence": number (0-1),
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your decision",
  "contentType": "Brief description of what type of content this is"
}

Be strict in your analysis - only classify content as educational if it genuinely contains learning material that students could benefit from conceptual pattern discovery.`;
