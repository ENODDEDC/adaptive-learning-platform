## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### **1. 8 Learning Modes Usage** ✅

**Location:** `src/components/DocumentToolsSidebar.js`

Your 8 learning mode buttons:
1. ✅ **AI Narrator** (Verbal Learning)
2. ✅ **Visual Learning**
3. ✅ **Sequential Learning**
4. ✅ **Global Learning**
5. ✅ **Sensing Learning**
6. ✅ **Intuitive Learning**
7. ✅ **Active Learning**
8. ✅ **Reflective Learning**

**What's tracked for each mode:**
- Count (how many times activated)
- Total time spent
- Last used timestamp

---

### **2. Behavioral Tracking System** ✅

**Location:** `src/utils/learningBehaviorTracker.js`

**Tracks:**
```javascript
✅ Mode usage (8 modes)
  - activeModeRatio, count, totalTime
  
✅ Content interactions
  - View duration
  - Completion rate
  - Scroll depth
  
✅ Activity engagement
  - Quizzes completed
  - Practice questions attempted
  - Discussion participation
  - Reflection journal entries
  - Visual diagrams viewed
  - Hands-on labs completed
  - Concept explorations
  - Sequential steps completed
```

---

### **3. Backend API** ✅

**Location:** `src/app/api/learning-behavior/track/route.js`

**Functionality:**
```javascript
✅ POST /api/learning-behavior/track
  - Receives behavior data
  - Stores in MongoDB
  - Calculates feature scores
  - Updates learning style profile
  
✅ GET /api/learning-behavior/track
  - Returns behavior summary
  - Aggregated statistics
  - Mode usage summary
```

## 🔄 How It Works (Complete Flow)

### **Step 1: User Opens PDF/DOCX**
```
User clicks on PDF/DOCX in /courses → Activities tab
↓
Document viewer opens
↓
8 learning mode buttons appear in DocumentToolsSidebar
```

### **Step 2: User Clicks Learning Mode**
```
User clicks "Visual Learning" button
↓
Component calls: onVisualContentClick()
↓
Tracker: trackModeStart('visualLearning')
↓
Records: start time, increments count
```

### **Step 3: User Uses the Mode**
```
User interacts with visual content
↓
Tracker records:
  - Time spent
  - Diagrams viewed
  - Interactions
```

### **Step 4: User Switches or Closes**
```
User clicks another mode or closes
↓
Tracker: trackModeEnd('visualLearning')
↓
Calculates: total duration
↓
Adds to batch queue
```

### **Step 5: Data Sent to Backend**
```
Every 30 seconds OR every 5 events
↓
POST /api/learning-behavior/track
↓
Saves to MongoDB (LearningBehavior collection)
↓
Updates LearningStyleProfile
```

### **Step 6: ML Classification**
```
After sufficient data collected
↓
Features calculated from behavior
↓
ML model predicts learning style
↓
Recommendations updated
```

## 📁 Database Structure

### **LearningBehavior Collection:**
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  sessionId: String,
  modeUsage: {
    aiNarrator: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    visualLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    sequentialLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    globalLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    sensingLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    intuitiveLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    activeLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed },
    reflectiveLearning: { count, totalTime, lastUsed }
  },
  contentInteractions: [...],
  activityEngagement: {...},
  features: {
    activeScore, reflectiveScore,
    sensingScore, intuitiveScore,
    visualScore, verbalScore,
    sequentialScore, globalScore
  },
  timestamp: Date
}
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **1. Check Browser Console:**
```javascript
// When user clicks learning mode button:
"📊 Tracking started: visualLearning"

// When user switches modes:
"📊 Tracking ended: visualLearning (45.2s)"

// When batch is sent:
"📤 Sent 5 behavior events"
```

### **2. Check Network Tab:**
```
POST /api/learning-behavior/track
Status: 200 OK
Response: { success: true, totalInteractions: 25 }
```

### **3. Check MongoDB:**
```javascript
// Query LearningBehavior collection
db.learningbehaviors.find({ userId: "..." })

// Should see:
{
  modeUsage: {
    visualLearning: { count: 10, totalTime: 3600000 },
    activeLearning: { count: 5, totalTime: 1800000 },
    ...
  }
}
```
