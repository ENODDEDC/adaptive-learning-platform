# Loading State Fix for AI Learning Mode Buttons

## Problem Identified
When clicking one AI Learning Mode button, multiple buttons were showing loading states simultaneously. This was happening because:

1. **AI Narrator** and **Visual Learning** buttons were both using the shared `isExtractingContent` state
2. **Other learning modes** had their own individual loading states
3. When `isExtractingContent` was set to `true`, both AI Narrator and Visual Learning buttons showed loading spinners

## Root Cause
The issue was in the state management design:
- `isExtractingContent` was being used for multiple buttons
- This created a shared loading state that affected multiple UI elements
- Users saw confusing behavior where clicking one button made multiple buttons appear to be loading

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Individual Loading States
Created separate loading states for each learning mode:
```javascript
const [isAITutorLoading, setIsAITutorLoading] = useState(false);
const [isVisualLearningLoading, setIsVisualLearningLoading] = useState(false);
const [isSequentialLearningLoading, setIsSequentialLearningLoading] = useState(false);
// ... and so on for all 8 learning modes
```

### 2. Updated Handler Functions
Modified each handler to use its own loading state:
- `handleAITutorClick` now uses `setIsAITutorLoading`
- `handleVisualContentClick` now uses `setIsVisualLearningLoading`
- All other handlers already had their individual states

### 3. Updated Component Props
Modified `CleanPDFViewer` component to:
- Accept individual loading state props for each button
- Use the correct loading state for each button's disabled state and spinner display
- Remove dependency on the shared `isExtractingContent` state

### 4. Cleaned Up Unused State
- Removed the `isExtractingContent` state that was causing conflicts
- Updated the content analysis loading indicator to show when any learning mode is loading
- Simplified the `extractPdfContent` function to remove unnecessary state management

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **src/components/PdfPreviewWithAI.js**
   - Added individual loading states for AI Narrator and Visual Learning
   - Updated handler functions to use their own loading states
   - Updated props passed to CleanPDFViewer
   - Removed shared `isExtractingContent` state

2. **src/components/CleanPDFViewer.js**
   - Updated component props to accept individual loading states
   - Modified AI Narrator and Visual Learning buttons to use their specific loading states
   - Ensured each button only shows loading when its own state is true

3. **src/app/test-pdf-viewer/page.js**
   - Added testing instructions to help verify the fix
   - Improved layout for better testing experience

## Verification Steps
1. Click AI Narrator button → Only AI Narrator shows loading
2. Click Visual Learning button → Only Visual Learning shows loading
3. Click Sequential Learning button → Only Sequential Learning shows loading
4. Test all 8 learning modes to ensure isolation
5. Verify no cross-contamination between button states

## Result
✅ **Fixed**: Each AI Learning Mode button now has its own independent loading state
✅ **Improved UX**: Users see clear feedback for which specific feature they activated
✅ **Better State Management**: Clean separation of concerns for each learning mode
✅ **No Side Effects**: Other functionality remains unchanged

The loading state issue has been completely resolved, and each button now operates independently with its own visual feedback.
