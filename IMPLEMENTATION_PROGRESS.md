# ML FSLSM Implementation Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure - IN PROGRESS

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Database Models ✅
- [x] Created `src/models/LearningBehavior.js`
  - Tracks mode usage for all 8 learning modes
  - Tracks content interactions
  - Tracks activity engagement
  - Calculates preliminary feature scores
  - Includes TTL index (90-day data retention)
  - Static methods for data analysis

- [x] Created `src/models/LearningStyleProfile.js`
  - FSLSM dimension scores (-11 to +11 scale)
  - Confidence scores for each dimension
  - Recommended modes with priorities
  - User feedback tracking
  - Data quality indicators
  - Helper methods for profile management

#### 2. Frontend Tracking ✅
- [x] Created `src/utils/learningBehaviorTracker.js`
  - Session ID generation
  - Mode tracking (start/end)
  - Content interaction tracking
  - Activity engagement tracking
  - Batch processing for efficiency
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Singleton pattern implementation

#### 3. Backend API ✅
- [x] Created `src/app/api/learning-behavior/track/route.js`
  - POST endpoint to receive behavior data
  - Data validation
  - Storage in MongoDB
  - Real-time feature score calculation
  - Profile data quality updates
  - GET endpoint for behavior summary

#### 4. Supporting Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Created `src/lib/auth.js` - JWT token verification
- [x] Created `src/lib/mongodb.js` - Database connection wrapper

#### 5. Component Integration - STARTED ✅
- [x] Integrated tracking into `ActiveLearning.js`
  - Mode usage tracking (start/end)
  - Discussion participation tracking
  - Automatic cleanup on unmount

### Next Steps

#### Remaining Component Integrations
- [ ] `ReflectiveLearning.js` - Track journal entries and contemplation time
- [ ] `SensingLearning.js` - Track lab completions

- [ ] `VisualContentModal.js` - Track diagram views
- [ ] `AITutorModal.js` - Track audio usage
- [ ] `SequentialLearning.js` - Track step completions
- [ ] `GlobalLearning.js` - Track overview views

#### Testing
- [ ] Test behavior tracking in browser console
- [ ] Verify data is stored in MongoDB
- [ ] Test with multiple users
- [ ] Check data quality and completeness
