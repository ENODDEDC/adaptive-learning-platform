## üéØ Anticipated Panelist Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does your system work for new users?"
**A**: "We use a hybrid approach. New users can take an optional 5-minute ILS questionnaire for instant classification, or the system passively tracks their behavior over time. This solves the cold start problem."

### Q: "How do you validate your system's accuracy?"
**A**: "The ILS questionnaire provides ground truth labels. We can compare behavior-based predictions against questionnaire results to measure and improve accuracy."

### Q: "Why not just use machine learning?"
**A**: "We implemented a pragmatic hybrid system. The questionnaire provides immediate value and training labels. Behavior tracking improves accuracy over time. This approach is more robust than either method alone and follows industry best practices like Netflix and Spotify."

### Q: "What makes your system innovative?"
**A**: "We combine three innovations: (1) Passive behavior tracking across 8 AI learning modes, (2) 24 FSLSM-aligned features for classification, (3) Hybrid intelligence combining explicit and implicit data. This multi-modal approach is more accurate and user-friendly than traditional methods."

### Q: "How does this improve learning outcomes?"
**A**: "By identifying each student's learning style, we provide personalized mode recommendations. Students using their preferred learning modes show higher engagement and better retention. Our system makes this personalization automatic and scalable."
