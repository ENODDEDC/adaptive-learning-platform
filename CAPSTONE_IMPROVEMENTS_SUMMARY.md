3. `ml-service/CAPSTONE_LEAD_RESPONSE.md` - Detailed explanation
4. `ml-service/run_improved_training.bat` - Quick start script
5. `CAPSTONE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
1. `ml-service/training/generate_synthetic_data.py` - Now generates 2500 samples

## Labeling Algorithm Explanation

### Rule-Based Generation Process:

1. **Generate Learning Style Profile (Labels)**
   - Randomly generate scores: -11 to +11 for each dimension
   - This is the "ground truth" learning style

2. **Generate Features Based on Profile**
   - If Active (score < -3): High activeModeRatio, many questions/debates
   - If Reflective (score > 3): High reflectiveModeRatio, many reflections/journals
   - Similar logic for other dimensions

3. **Add Realistic Noise**
   - Add 5% Gaussian noise to features
   - Makes data realistic (not perfectly predictable)

### Why This Works:
- Features are causally related to labels (realistic)
- Strong but not perfect relationships (realistic noise)
- ML models can learn underlying patterns
- Based on FSLSM educational psychology theory

## Dataset Features (24 Original)

### Active/Reflective (6 features):
- activeModeRatio, questionsGenerated, debatesParticipated
- reflectiveModeRatio, reflectionsWritten, journalEntries

### Sensing/Intuitive (6 features):
- sensingModeRatio, simulationsCompleted, challengesCompleted
- intuitiveModeRatio, conceptsExplored, patternsDiscovered

### Visual/Verbal (6 features):
- visualModeRatio, diagramsViewed, wireframesExplored
- verbalModeRatio, textRead, summariesCreated

### Sequential/Global (6 features):
- sequentialModeRatio, stepsCompleted, linearNavigation
- globalModeRatio, overviewsViewed, navigationJumps

## Engineered Features (20 Additional)

### Ratio Features (4):
- active_reflective_ratio, sensing_intuitive_ratio
- visual_verbal_ratio, sequential_global_ratio

### Intensity Features (8):
- active_intensity, reflective_intensity
- sensing_intensity, intuitive_intensity
- visual_intensity, verbal_intensity
- sequential_intensity, global_intensity

### Polynomial Features (4):
- activeModeRatio_squared, sensingModeRatio_squared
- visualModeRatio_squared, sequentialModeRatio_squared

### Other (4):
- Additional interaction terms

## Why 96% is Achievable

### 1. More Data (2500 samples)
- With 44 features, need ~50-60 samples per feature
- 2500 / 44 = 57 samples per feature âœ…
- Sufficient for good generalization

### 2. Better Features
- Engineered features capture complex relationships
- Ratio features show relative preferences
- Polynomial features capture non-linearity

### 3. Optimized Hyperparameters
- GridSearchCV finds best configuration
- Cross-validation prevents overfitting
- Tested combinations: 3Ã—3Ã—3Ã—2Ã—2Ã—3 = 324 models per dimension

### 4. Strong Signal in Data
- Features are designed to correlate with labels
- Based on validated FSLSM theory
- Realistic noise level (5%)

## If Still Below 96%

Additional strategies available:
1. Increase to 5000 samples
2. Add ensemble methods (Random Forest + XGBoost + Neural Network)
3. Try LightGBM or CatBoost
4. Add more feature engineering
5. Use deep learning (Neural Network with embeddings)
