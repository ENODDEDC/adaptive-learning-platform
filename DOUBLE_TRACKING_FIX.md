# Double Tracking Fix - DOCX vs PDF

## Problem Identified

DOCX file preview was counting 2 interactions per button click, while PDF was counting correctly (1 interaction).

## Root Cause

**DOCX Component had DUPLICATE tracking:**

1. **Parent Component** (`DocxPreviewWithAI.js`) had tracking hooks:
   ```javascript
   useLearningModeTracking('aiNarrator', aiTutorActive);
   useLearningModeTracking('visualLearning', showVisualOverlay);
   ```

2. **Child Modal Components** (SequentialLearning, GlobalLearning, etc.) ALSO had tracking hooks:
   ```javascript
   useLearningModeTracking('sequentialLearning', isActive);
   ```

This caused **double counting** because:
- When you clicked a button, the modal opened
- The modal's tracking hook fired → Count +1
- The parent's tracking logic also fired → Count +1
- **Result: 2 interactions recorded**

**PDF Component did NOT have this issue** because:
- CleanPDFViewer does NOT use `useLearningModeTracking` hooks
- Only the modal components track
- **Result: 1 interaction recorded (correct)**

## Solution Applied

**Removed duplicate tracking from DocxPreviewWithAI.js:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG - Double tracking):
useLearningModeTracking('aiNarrator', aiTutorActive);
useLearningModeTracking('visualLearning', showVisualOverlay);

// AFTER (CORRECT - Single tracking):
// Note: Tracking is handled by individual modal components
// Each modal has its own useLearningModeTracking hook to avoid double-counting
```

Now tracking only happens in the modal components, just like PDF viewer.

## Files Modified

- `src/components/DocxPreviewWithAI.js` - Removed duplicate tracking hooks

## Testing

**Before Fix:**
```
1. Open DOCX file
2. Click "Sequential Learning" button
3. Check database → 2 interactions recorded ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
1. Open DOCX file
2. Click "Sequential Learning" button  
3. Check database → 1 interaction recorded ✅
```

## Verification

Both PDF and DOCX now use the same tracking pattern:
- ✅ Parent component: NO tracking hooks
- ✅ Modal components: Each has its own tracking hook
- ✅ Result: 1 interaction per button click

## Why This Matters for ML

Accurate interaction counting is critical for:
1. **ML Classification** - Model learns from actual usage patterns
2. **Data Quality** - "10 interactions" threshold is meaningful
3. **Personalization** - Recommendations based on true preferences
4. **Analytics** - Accurate usage statistics

Double-counting would have:
- Made users reach "10 interactions" threshold too quickly
- Skewed ML model training data
- Given false impression of user preferences
- Inflated usage statistics

## Related Components

All modal components have their own tracking:
- ✅ `SequentialLearning.js` - tracks 'sequentialLearning'
- ✅ `GlobalLearning.js` - tracks 'globalLearning'
- ✅ `SensingLearning.js` - tracks 'sensingLearning'
- ✅ `IntuitiveLearning.js` - tracks 'intuitiveLearning'
- ✅ `ActiveLearning.js` - tracks 'activeLearning'
- ✅ `ReflectiveLearning.js` - tracks 'reflectiveLearning'
- ✅ `AITutorModal.js` - tracks 'aiNarrator'
- ✅ `VisualContentModal.js` - tracks 'visualLearning'

Parent components should NOT duplicate this tracking.
